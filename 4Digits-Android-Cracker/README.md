Use the "4Digits-Android-Cracker" only for educational purposes!

I made two slightly different crackers and uploaded the result. So if you want, you can just start cracking with your Malduino or Rubber Ducky.

The regular "4Digits-Cracker" tries all possibilities from 0000 to 9999.
The "4Digits-Cracker-30sec" waits 30 seconds after every 5th try, because some phones are locked for 30secs after 5 attempts.

The python scripts generate the uploaded textfile. So you can modify the script for your needs.

Have fun,

Zwoschi :)
